Node Design follows the identity of correlating the array position with what is determined to be a valid entry. Will update the array with the correct correlating image, and use the other images inside of the dataset to determine what is a rat, and what is not a rat.

Public data set from Kaggle with 28,000 images of animals, which include the rat sections which will be used as the main point of reference as this is trying to identify what is a rat, and what is not.
